    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of cylindrical rice cakes</li>
        <li>4 cups of water</li>
        <li>7 large sized anchovies with both head and intenstine removed</li>
        <li>6 by 8 inch dried kelp</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of gochujang</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of gochugaru</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of sugar</li>
        <li>3 green onions</li>
        <li>2 hard boiled eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 pound of fish cakes</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the water, dried anchovies, and kelp to a shallow pan.</li>
        <li>Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Combine gochujang (hot pepper paste), gochugaru (hot pepper flakes), and sugar in a small bowl. Remove the anchovies and kelp from the pot and add the rice cake, the mixture in the bowl, the green onion, and the optional fish cakes and hard boiled eggs.</li>
        <li>Stir gently with a wooden spoon when it starts to boil. Let it simmer and keep stirring until the rice cake turns soft and the tteokbokki sauce thickens and looks shiny, which should take about 10 to 15 minutes. If the rice cake is not soft enough, add more water and continue stirring until it softens. When you use freshly made rice cake, it takes shorter time. If you use frozen rice cake, thaw it out and soak in cold water to soften it before cooking.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
